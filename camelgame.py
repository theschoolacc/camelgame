        Welcome to the Camel Game!
    ====================================
    Youâ€™ve taken a camel to journey across the vast Sahara desert.
    The locals are pursuing you to reclaim their camel.
    Endure your desert adventure and stay ahead of the natives.

    Instructions:
    - Choose actions each turn to manage thirst, camel tiredness, and distance.
    - Reach 200 miles to win. If the natives catch you, you lose!
    - Find oases for a boost. Good luck!
