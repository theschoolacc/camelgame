====================================
    Welcome to the Camel Game!
====================================
Youâ€™ve taken a camel to journey across the vast Sahara desert.
The locals are pursuing you to reclaim their camel.
Endure your desert adventure and stay ahead of the natives.

Instructions:
- Choose actions each turn to manage thirst, camel tiredness, and distance.
- Reach 200 miles to win. If the natives catch you, you lose!
- Find oases for a boost. Good luck!
